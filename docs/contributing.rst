Cleaning your environment
=========================

There are three levels of cleaning your environment:

 - ``make clean`` will remove ``*.pyc`` files and ``__pycache__`` directory.
 - ``make distclean`` will also remove ``*.egg-info`` files and ``*.egg``,
   ``build`` and ``dist`` directories.
 - ``make maintainer-clean`` will also remove the ``.tox`` and the
   ``.venv`` directories.
